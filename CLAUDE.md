# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dev-Toolkit is a Go CLI tool (binary: `dev`) that manages Git repositories across multiple providers, provides language-aware project commands, and includes system housekeeping utilities. Built with Cobra (CLI), logrus (logging), gitforge (multi-provider Git operations), langforge (language detection), and cliforge (self-update).

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
make build          # Build binary to bin/dev (~1 second), always run after changes
make run            # go run ./cmd/dev-toolkit (shows help)
make debug          # Build with debug symbols (-N -l)
make build-musl     # Fully static binary via musl-gcc (requires musl toolchain)
make install        # Build and copy to ~/.local/bin/dev
make lint           # Lint via external pipelines repo
make test           # Test via external pipelines repo
make sast           # SAST security suite via external pipelines repo
```

The Makefile includes shared targets from `$(HOME)/Development/github.com/rios0rios0/pipelines`. Never call tool binaries directly -- always use `make` targets.

## Usage

```bash
dev repo clone mine ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0        # clone missing repos
dev repo clone mine --dry-run                                   # preview without cloning
dev repo sync ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0               # sync all repos
dev repo fork-sync ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0          # sync forks with upstream
dev repo fork-sync ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0 --dry-run # preview fork sync
dev repo prune ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0              # delete merged branches
dev repo prune ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0 --dry-run    # preview without deleting
dev repo worktree list ~/Development/github.com/rios0rios0      # list linked worktrees + classification

### Key Design Decisions

- **Provider detection**: Mapper pattern from directory path segments (`github.com` -> `"github"`, `dev.azure.com` -> `"azuredevops"`, `codeberg.org` -> `"codeberg"`)
- **Parallel operations**: Goroutines with semaphore channel (`runtime.NumCPU()` workers)
- **External tools**: `git`, `docker`, `ssh` and `sh` are deliberately taken from the user's PATH (they live somewhere different on every supported platform, so absolute paths are not an option). `executable.Resolve` looks each one up once per process in a single audited place and refuses relative results; commands then run through that absolute path, never by bare name (SonarCloud `go:S4036`)
- **Git operations**: Uses `exec.Command` on the resolved `git` binary behind `GitRunner` interface for testability
- **SSH cloning**: Sets `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` and `BatchMode=yes`
- **Language detection**: Uses langforge's `LanguageRegistry` behind `LanguageDetector` interface for testability
- **Docker operations**: Uses `exec.Command` on the resolved `docker` binary behind `docker.Runner` interface for testability
- **System operations**: Uses `exec.Command(...)` behind `system.Runner` and `FileSystem` interfaces; platform-gated via `runtime.GOOS`
- **Credential resolution**: A `CredentialResolver` chain, not a bare `os.Getenv`. `EnvCredentialResolver` reads the provider's token env var; `CLICredentialResolver` asks the provider's own CLI for one (`gh auth token`, `az account get-access-token` scoped to the Azure DevOps resource, `glab auth token`), so an already authenticated CLI removes the need to export a second token. `ChainCredentialResolver` tries them in order -- env first, so an explicit token still overrides the CLI -- and on total failure reports *every* reason rather than only the last. Providers with no CLI integration (Codeberg) simply have no entry in `providerCLIMap` and stay env-only. Every consumer (`ResolveProvider`, `ResolveForkResolver`, `gist.ResolveProvider`) goes through the chain
- **Fork sync**: Uses `ForkResolver` interface to query provider APIs for parent repo info; auto-adds `upstream` remote
- **Worktree detection**: A linked worktree stores `.git` as a *file*, so the `.git`-directory scanners (`ScanFlatRepos`, `ScanNestedRepos`, `FindAllRepos`) never see one. This is intentional: worktrees are extra checkouts of repos that exist on the remote, so they must stay out of the clone remote-vs-local diff. `worktree.go` reads them from `git worktree list --porcelain` instead
- **Worktree classification**: Ordered rule tables (`worktreeGuardRules`, `worktreeRemovalRules`) instead of branching; guards (locked, detached, dirty, unpushed) are always evaluated before removal rules, so preserving work wins over cleaning up. Removal always goes through `git worktree remove`/`git worktree prune`, never `os.RemoveAll`, to keep the parent repo's metadata consistent
- **SAST orchestration**: Runs each tool (CodeQL, Semgrep, Trivy, Hadolint, Gitleaks) with per-tool failure isolation and embedded default configs
- **Dependency injection**: Business logic accepts interfaces (`GitRunner`, `ForgeProvider`, `ForkResolver`, `CredentialResolver`, `CLIRunner`, `LanguageDetector`, `CommandRunner`, `ConfigReader`, `docker.Runner`, `system.Runner`, `FileSystem`, `io.Writer`) for testability
- **Project dependencies**: `.dev.yaml` declares relative paths to dependent projects; resolved via DFS topological sort with cycle detection
- **Automatic update check**: On startup (via cliforge), skipped for `version`, `self-update`, and local dev builds
- **No switch/case**: All dispatch uses mapper pattern (maps of string -> value/function)

### Dependencies

- **gitforge** -- Multi-provider Git hosting abstractions (GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab, Codeberg)
- **go-github** -- GitHub API client (used by `ForkResolver` to get fork parent info)
- **langforge** -- Language detection, version management, and runtime information (Go, Dart, Node, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, Terraform)
- **cliforge** -- Self-update mechanism and automatic version check on startup

## Changelog (chlog) — MANDATORY

If the repository you are working in uses chlog (a `.chlog.yaml` or `.chlog.yml`
config file, or a `.changes/` directory, exists at the project root), the
following is binding and ALWAYS applies: whenever you make ANY change, you MUST
create a changelog fragment as part of the same change — automatically, without
being asked, before committing.

- Do NOT edit CHANGELOG.md directly; it is generated from fragments.
- Create the fragment with:
  `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "<imperative description>"`
- Valid kinds: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Choose the kind that best matches the change (e.g., new feature → Added,
  bug fix → Fixed, behavior change → Changed, removal → Removed, security fix → Security).
- If the change is backward-INCOMPATIBLE with the public API (a breaking
  change), you MUST add the `--breaking` flag:
  `chlog new --kind <Kind> --breaking --body "<description>"`.
  This is the ONLY thing that triggers a major version bump — the kind alone
  never does (per SemVer, major = incompatible change). When unsure whether a
  change breaks compatibility, ask the user instead of guessing.
- Fragments are YAML files in `.changes/unreleased/`; stage them with your commit.
- `chlog check` fails the build when a fragment is missing — never skip it.
