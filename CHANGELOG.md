# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file is not edited by hand. Every change writes its own fragment under
`.changes/unreleased/` with [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog), and a release compiles
the pending fragments into a version section here — so two branches each adding an entry no
longer touch the same lines, and a rebase that used to conflict on this file now conflicts on
nothing.

When a new release is proposed:

1. Create a new branch `bump/x.x.x` (this isn't a long-lived branch!!!);
2. The fragments pending under `.changes/unreleased/` are compiled into a version section by `chlog batch auto && chlog merge` (AutoBump does this for you — it reads the fragments directly);
3. Open a Pull Request with the bump version changes targeting the `main` branch;
4. When the Pull Request is merged, a new Git tag must be created using [GitHub environment](https://github.com/rios0rios0/versainit/tags).

Releases to productive environments should run from a tagged version.
Exceptions are acceptable depending on the circumstances (critical bug fixes that can be cherry-picked, etc.).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.9] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.8] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- changed both `chlog new` examples in the AI-assistant instruction block of `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to `--body '<past-tense description>'`: changelog bodies here are written in simple past tense, and the body is single-quoted because it carries backticks that a double-quoted shell argument would command-substitute, and added the line telling the reader to write an apostrophe inside the single-quoted body as `'\''`, since bodies here carry possessives, and switched the 4 other hand-written `chlog new` examples in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/pull_request_template/default.md`, and `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` to the same single-quoted body argument
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.7] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- declared test files as test sources for SonarCloud Automatic Analysis so duplicated test setup no longer fails the quality gate
- fixed the SonarCloud `go:S4036` security hotspots by resolving the `git`, `docker`, `ssh` and `sh` binaries once per process through one audited helper and running them by absolute path, which also reports a missing tool clearly instead of an empty error

## [0.10.6] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.5] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.4] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- changed the Go version to `1.27.1` and updated all module dependencies

## [0.10.3] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.2] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- changed the Claude workflows to call the reusable workflows in `rios0rios0/pipelines` instead of `rios0rios0/.github`, which is where every other reusable workflow and composite action already lives, and renamed them to `claude-review.yaml` and `claude-mention.yaml`, matching the `reusable-claude-review.yaml` / `reusable-claude-mention.yaml` definitions they call
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

### Fixed

- restored the `.changes/unreleased/` directory with a `.gitkeep`, so the release tooling keeps recognising this project as [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog)-based after a release consumes the last fragment. Git tracks files rather than directories, so the bump commit that removed the final fragment removed the directory too, and the next run read the empty `[Unreleased]` section as "nothing to release"
- restored the `id-token: write` permission on both Claude workflow callers. Without it the caller grants less than the reusable workflow declares, which GitHub rejects before the job starts -- runs ended in `startup_failure`. The action needs the scope because `setupGitHubToken()` exchanges a GitHub OIDC token for the GitHub App token it posts with, unless a `github_token` is passed explicitly.

### Removed

- removed the unused `id-token: write` permission from the Claude workflow callers, and changed `claude-review.yaml`'s display name to `Claude Review` so it matches its file name and its `Claude Mention` sibling. `anthropics/claude-code-action` needs `id-token: write` only for workload identity federation or the Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry OIDC paths; these authenticate with `claude_code_oauth_token`, so the scope allowed minting OIDC tokens for any audience without ever being used.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- added a tailored `code-review` skill under `.github/skills/` so GitHub Copilot reviews changes against the [rios0rios0/guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki) standards and this repository's own load-bearing invariants
- added credential resolution through the provider's own CLI, so an already authenticated `gh`, `az`, or `glab` covers the provider API calls and no second token has to be exported. Credentials now come from a `CredentialResolver` chain instead of a bare `os.Getenv`: the provider's token environment variable first (an explicitly exported token still wins), then `gh auth token`, `az account get-access-token` scoped to the Azure DevOps resource, or `glab auth token`. Codeberg has no widely installed official CLI and stays environment-only. When nothing can authenticate, the error now names every option rather than only the first one that failed. Cloning and syncing were already over SSH, so `dev repo clone` on a machine with SSH keys and `gh auth login` needs nothing else

### Changed

- changed the changelog to [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog) fragments: a change now writes its own YAML file under `.changes/unreleased/` through `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "..."`, and `CHANGELOG.md` is GENERATED from them at release time by `chlog batch auto && chlog merge`. That is the one thing a single shared file cannot do — two branches each adding an entry no longer touch the same lines, so a rebase that used to conflict on `CHANGELOG.md` now conflicts on nothing. The `[Unreleased]` section was empty, so nothing had to be carried across. AutoBump already reads the fragments directly, so the release flow is unchanged.
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

### Fixed

- fixed the `main` pipeline, which every repository's `sast:gitleaks` job had been failing since the code-review skill landed: the skill's own security bullet listed credential prefixes verbatim to warn against writing them, and the scanner's second pass matches those prefixes on their own, so the warning tripped the rule it was describing. The bullet now names the vendors instead, and the commit that carried the original wording is allowlisted by fingerprint in `.gitleaksignore`, because the scan walks the whole history reachable from `HEAD` and no edit at the tip can clear a past commit. No credential was ever committed.
- fixed the documented minimum Go toolchain in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which still said 1.26+ while `go.mod` requires `go 1.27.0`

### Removed

- removed the stale "update the version in `src/main.go`" item from the bump pull request checklist: there is no `src/` directory, and the build version is injected by the `Makefile` through `-X main.version=$(VERSION)` from the latest Git tag, so there is nothing to edit by hand

## [0.9.9] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.8] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- changed struct literals and `errors.As` calls to the Go 1.27 forms required by the `modernize` linter
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions
- changed the Go version to `1.27.0` and updated all module dependencies
- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to require Go 1.27+ matching `go.mod`

## [0.9.7] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- changed `langforge` to `v1.0.0`, which makes Dart/Flutter projects detectable by every `dev project` command -- this crosses a MAJOR boundary, but both breaking changes (the per-ecosystem `Provider` structs replaced by `repositories.CompositeProvider`, and `javagradle.RuntimeManager`/`javamaven.RuntimeManager` merged into a shared `java.RuntimeManager`) only affect callers naming those concrete types, which this project never did
- changed the Go version to `1.26.6` and updated all module dependencies

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- added `dev repo worktree list` to report every linked Git worktree under a directory together with the reason it is disposable or protected
- added `dev repo worktree prune` to remove linked worktrees that outlived their purpose: stale registrations whose directory is gone, worktrees living outside the scanned root, worktrees whose branch is merged into the default branch, and worktrees whose upstream branch was deleted on the remote
- added a `--prune-worktrees` flag to `dev repo clone` that runs the same worktree cleanup pass after the clone workflow

### Fixed

- fixed `dev repo worktree` marking every worktree as living outside the root when the root directory was given as a relative path (e.g. `./backend`): Git reports absolute worktree paths, and `filepath.Rel` fails when only one side is relative, so `isInsideRoot` classified all of them as disposable. The root is now resolved to an absolute path, and an uncomparable path is treated as inside the root so it is never reported as disposable
- fixed `make test` and `make sast` leaving generated reports (`reports/`, `coverage.txt`, `coverage.xml`, `cobertura.xml`, `junit.xml`) as untracked files by adding them to `.gitignore`
- fixed linked Git worktrees being invisible to every repository workflow: `ScanFlatRepos`, `ScanNestedRepos`, and `FindAllRepos` required `.git` to be a directory, but a linked worktree stores `.git` as a file, so worktrees were silently skipped by `clone`, `sync`, `prune`, and the remaining repo commands. Worktrees are deliberately kept out of the clone remote-vs-local diff -- they are extra checkouts of repositories that do exist on the remote, so deleting them as "extra" would corrupt the parent repository's metadata -- and are handled by the dedicated `worktree` commands instead
- fixed the unanchored `dev-toolkit` entry in `.gitignore` also matching the `cmd/dev-toolkit/` source directory, which made any newly added file there impossible to commit; all entries are now anchored to the repository root

## [0.8.17] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

### Security

- hardened directory permissions from `0o750` to owner-only `0o700` in the SAST report and Git clone helpers and their test fixtures, resolving the Semgrep `incorrect-default-permission` CI failures (a directory needs the owner execute bit, so the rule's `0o600` file threshold is documented as inapplicable and suppressed per line)

## [0.8.16] - 2026-07-14

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.8.15] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

### Security

- replaced `secrets: inherit` with an explicit `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` pass-through in the Claude Code workflows to satisfy the `secrets-inherit` least-privilege check

- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to document gist commands, missing repo subcommands (prune, failover, restore), `dev version`, and Codeberg authentication

## [0.8.4] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- changed the Go version to `1.26.3` and updated all module dependencies

### Fixed

- fixed `golangci-lint` `modernize` finding in `RunStopWithDeps` by replacing the manual reverse loop with `slices.Backward`
- fixed `ListMergedBranches` to strip the worktree `+ ` prefix from `git branch --merged` output, so branches checked out in another worktree are no longer skipped during prune
- fixed all `golangci-lint` `goconst` findings by extracting repeated string literals (provider names, log field keys, status categories, Docker `prune`/`--force` flags, language identifiers) into package-level constants

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- changed `cmd/devforge/` directory to `cmd/dev-toolkit/`
- changed Go module path from `github.com/rios0rios0/devforge` to `github.com/rios0rios0/dev-toolkit` to align with the convention that reserves the `forge` suffix for libraries (`gitforge`, `langforge`, `cliforge`)
- changed install script environment variable prefix from `DEVFORGE_*` to `DEV_TOOLKIT_*`
- changed project name from `devforge` to `dev-toolkit` (binary remains `dev`)
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- added `dev gist clone` command -- discovers GitHub gists for a user and clones missing ones via SSH in parallel, where the user-supplied root directory is the owner directory (`gist.github.com/<owner>`) and each gist lands at `<root-dir>/<slug>`. The slug is derived from the gist description (or the gist ID when blank); colliding slugs are disambiguated with a short ID suffix
- added `dev gist sync` command -- fetches and rebases all gist repositories one level under the root directory, preserving uncommitted work via WIP branches (same workflow as `dev repo sync`)
- added `GistProviderStub` test double for unit testing the gist workflow
- added `internal/gist` package with `Provider` interface, `GitHubProvider` implementation backed by `go-github`, slug derivation, `AssignKeys` collision handling, scanner, and clone/sync orchestration
- added `repo.SSHPreflightHost` for verifying SSH access to a host that is not registered in the provider registry (used by gist commands to preflight `gist.github.com`)

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- refreshed `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to document commands, packages, and design patterns added in v0.3.0–v0.7.0 (system utilities, Codeberg support, SAST orchestration, mirror/failover/restore, cliforge self-update)

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- fixed `dev repo prune` only scanning the top-level directory (e.g. missing nested repos like `org/project/repo`) -- it now walks the directory tree recursively using `FindAllRepos`, matching the behavior of `dev repo sync`

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- fixed `dev project use` emitting `gvm use go<X.Y>` for 2-segment `go.mod` directives (e.g. `go 1.26`), which gvm rejects with a misleading "It doesn't look like Go has been installed" error -- the command now resolves the highest installed patch via `gvm list` and falls back to a clean `[dev]` install hint when no match exists
- fixed `dev project use` emitting an install hint containing unescaped `<patch>` placeholder that would break when copy-pasted into a shell due to `<`/`>` redirection parsing -- the hint now points users to `gvm listall | grep '^go<X.Y>\.'` so they can pick a valid patch version
- fixed `dev project use` leaking the internal `_dev_go` helper variable into the caller's shell after `eval` -- the emitted command now `unset`s it once the switch or hint has run
- fixed `dev project use` producing the same misleading gvm error when the exact 3-segment Go version from `go.mod` is not yet installed -- the command now guards the `gvm use` call with a presence check and prints a `[dev] gvm install go<version>` hint instead

- changed clone workflow to log each repository's URL and target directory in real-time during parallel clone
- changed the Go module dependencies to their latest versions

### Fixed

- fixed SSH preflight to detect successful authentication from stderr output instead of relying on exit codes, resolving false failures with Azure DevOps (which returns exit code 255 on success)
